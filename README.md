# Hello! I'm Nnamdi Charles Okonkwo 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the digital world! I'm a Front-End Engineer based in Nigeria 🇳🇬, fascinated by the power of code to create intuitive and impactful web experiences.

What truly excites me about front-end development is bridging the gap between design and technology – crafting interfaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also accessible, performant, and genuinely user-friendly. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems creatively and continuously learning new ways to build better for the web.

## ✨ What I Love to Work With

While I'm always learning, here are some of the tools and technologies I frequently use:

* JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
* React.js
* Tailwind CSS / Styled Components
* Git for version control

## 🌱 My Current Learning Journey

Right now, I'm particularly interested in:

* Diving deeper into [e.g., Web Accessibility best practices (WCAG)].
* Exploring [e.g., State management patterns in large applications].
* Improving my skills in [e.g., Front-end testing methodologies].
